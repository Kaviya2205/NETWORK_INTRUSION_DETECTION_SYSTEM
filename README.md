# üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning

An AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System designed to identify malicious traffic and safeguard computer networks. This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to detect common attack types such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R based on the popular NSL-KDD dataset.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Detect potential cyber threats in network traffic using machine learning.
- Classify network behavior as **normal** or **malicious**.
- Provide insights into the type of intrusion (e.g., DoS, Probe).
- Build a reliable and scalable NIDS that can be integrated into real-time systems.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Dataset**: NSL-KDD (cleaned and preprocessed version)
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Optional UI**: Streamlit for interactive testing

## üß™ Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

You can tune hyperparameters and compare model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.
